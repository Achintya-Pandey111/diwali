My Portfolio Website

Hey everyone! 
This is my personal portfolio website — something I built to showcase who I am, what I’ve been learning, and what I can do.
It’s made using HTML and CSS, and it’s still a work in progress as I keep learning and improving every day.

About

I’m Achintya Pandey, a passionate learner from Newton School of Technology (ADYPU).
I love exploring coding, design, and everything that helps me build creative and useful stuff.

This portfolio is a small reflection of my learning journey — from basics of Python to front-end development with HTML and CSS.

What’s Inside :

A clean navigation bar that sticks on top.

A simple intro section with my photo.

A short about me section.

My skills section where I’ve listed the things I’m learning.

A projects section to display what I’ve built (and what’s coming soon).

A small contact form where people can reach out to me.

Tech I Used

HTML5 for structure

CSS3 for design and layout

That’s it! I wanted to keep it minimal and clean without using any frameworks or libraries.
